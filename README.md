# VersionList：

| Version | Date | File | Content |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v-1.0.0 | 23.08.22:17 | `Dinocolumba_send_I` `Dinocolumba_receive_I` | Designed the basic message transmission structure. |
| v-1.0.1 | 23.08.22:19 | `Dinocolumba_send_II` `Dinocolumba_receive_II` | Added encryption using the `Fernet` Symmetric-key algorithm method for basic security in message transmission. |
| v-1.0.2 | 23.08.23:17 | `Dinocolumba_send_IIi` `Dinocolumba_receive_IIi` | Added encryption using the `Caesar cipher` Substitution cipher method, scrambling both the public and private keys. |
| v-1.1.0 | 23.08.24:10 | `Dinocolumba_send_J` `Dinocolumba_receive_J` | Optimized the transmission process to support multiple message transmissions and removed `Fernet` for ease of future updates. |
| v-1.2.0 | 23.08.25:09 | `Dinocolumba_send_1.2.0` `Dinocolumba_receive_1.2.0` `Dinocolumba_commcode_I` `Dinocolumba_decode_I`| This program includes the addition of a feature to generate the `Communication code`, utilizing `Fernet` for Symmetric-key algorithm encryption and generating `key words`. |
| v-1.2.1 | 23.08.28:19 | `Dinocolumba_send_1.2.1` `Dinocolumba_receive_1.2.1` `Dinocolumba_commcode_II` `Dinocolumba_decode_II`| Enhanced encryption, improved key management, added checksum, introduced usernames, and implemented a series of measures for enhancement. |

# Attention：

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Please enter the correct IP address ( If it's a local machine, you can send the IP address as `localhost` ) .　 　 　 　 　
> - Please enter the correct `Communication code`, otherwise the program will close automatically ( Using the `Dinocolumba_commcode` program to create the Communication code ) .
> - Both parties must ensure to securely store the `Communication code`, otherwise the connection between the two parties will not be established.

> [!WARNING]
> - Please follow the instructions provided in the program's usage guide, otherwise errors may occur !
> - For detailed precautions, please refer to its version !

> [!NOTE]
