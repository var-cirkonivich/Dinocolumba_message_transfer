# ⚠️ Attention：

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Please enter the correct IP address ( If it's a local machine, you can send the IP address as `localhost` ) .　 　 　 　 　
> - Please enter the correct `Communication code`, otherwise the program will close automatically ( Using the `Dinocolumba_commcode` program to create the Communication code ) .
> - Both parties must ensure to securely store the `Communication code`, otherwise the connection between the two parties will not be established.

> [!WARNING]
> - Please follow the instructions provided in the program's usage guide, otherwise errors may occur !
> - For detailed precautions, please refer to its version !

> [!NOTE]
